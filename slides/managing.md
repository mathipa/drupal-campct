# Managing Drupal Sites
There are 4 primary areas we need to care about in order to rapidly iterate on a Drupal development project:

1. <strong>Site content</strong> - which lives in the database
2. <strong>Site configuration</strong> - also lives in the database, but we want it in code so it can be committed to version control
3. <strong>Site Assets</strong> - lives on the file system typically in the sites/all/files folder
4. <strong>Simple build system</strong> - quickly building “throw-away” site instances which allow rapid iterationMe
